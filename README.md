# MedicalDigitalHuman: Skin, Skeleton and Organ
This project is aimed to build a 3D digital twin of a human for medical use. Nowadays, 3D human model is mostly built in the standard template, while a personalized model is able to provide more accurate information and customized service for each patient. Therefore,
how to build a personalized model in an effective and efficient way is about to explore in this project.
